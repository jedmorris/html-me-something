       <h2>My 3-Year Adventure Living in Germany </h2>
       <p> This webpage is designed to provide an overview of some of the different countries I visited while living in Germany for the past three years. I visited 17 
           countries in total but here are the four I spent the most time in. Enjoy! 
      </p>
       <h2>Countries I Visited</h2>

       <h3>Germany</h3>
        <p>I lived in Stuttgart, Germany for three years with my wife Jessica and our border collie Sunshine. Suttgart served as our 'home base' as we traveled throughout Europe.</p>

        <h3>France</h3>
        <p>Jessica and I were able to visit Paris several times. The first time we visited Paris, I had a perception that it was overrated but I soon discovered that I was very wrong. 
            Paris quickly became one of our favorite destinations!

        <h3>United Kingdom</h3>
        <p>I was able to visit the U.K., and London specifically, twice. The second time was during Christmas and the decorations were incredible!</p>
